                must be registered to ensure the ‘studentship’ in any semester.

                <br>4.5 Choice for ‘additional subjects / courses’ to reach the maximum permissible limit of 28 credits
                (above
                the typical 24 credit norm) must be clearly indicated, which needs the specific approval and signature
                of the
                faculty advisor / counselor.

                <br>4.6 If the student submits ambiguous choices or multiple options or erroneous entries during on-line
                registration for the subject(s) / course(s) under a given / specified course group / category as listed
                in the
                course structure, only the first mentioned subject / course in that category will be taken into
                consideration.

                <br>4.7 Subject / course options exercised through on-line registration are final and cannot be changed
                or
                inter-changed; further, alternate choices also will not be considered. However, if the subject / course
                that has
                already been listed for registration by the Head of the Department in a semester could not be offered
                due to any
                unforeseen or unexpected reasons, then the student shall be allowed to have alternate choice either for
                a new
                subject (subject to offering of such a subject), or for another existing subject (subject to
                availability of
                seats). Such alternate arrangements will be made by the head of the department, with due notification
                and
                time-framed schedule, within the first week after the commencement of class-work for that semester.

                <br>4.8 Dropping of subjects / courses may be permitted, only after obtaining prior approval from the
                faculty
                advisor / counselor (subject to retaining a minimum of 20 credits), ‘within a period of 15 days’ from
                the
                beginning of the current semester.

                <br>4.9 Open electives: students are to choose one open elective (OE-I) during III year I semester, one
                (OE-II)
                during III year II semester, and one (OE-III) in IV year II semester, from the list of open electives
                given.
                However, student cannot opt for an open elective subject offered by their own (parent) department, if it
                is
                already listed under any category of the subjects offered by parent department in any semester.

                <br>4.10 Professional electives: students are to choose professional elective (PE-I) during III year
                semester,
                Professional electives II, III, and IV (PE-II, III and IV) during IV year I semester, Professional
                electives V,
                and VI (PE-V and VI) in IV year II semester, from the list of professional electives given. However,
                students
                may opt for professional elective subjects offered in the related area.

                <br><br><b>5.0 Subjects / courses to be offered</b>

                <br>5.1 A typical section (or class) strength for each semester shall be 60.

                <br>5.2 A subject / course may be offered to the students, only if a minimum of 20 students (1 / 3 of
                the
                section strength) opt for it. The maximum strength of a section is limited to 80 (60 + 1 / 3 of the
                section
                strength).

                <br>5.3 More than one teacher may offer the same subject (lab / practical may be included with the
                corresponding
                theory subject in the same semester) in any semester. However, selection of choice for students will be
                based on
                – ‘first come first serve basis and CGPA criterion’ (i.e. the first focus shall be on early on-line
                entry from
                the student for registration in that semester, and the second focus, if needed, will be on CGPA of the
                student).

                <br>5.4 If more entries for registration of a subject come into picture, then the Head of Department
                concerned
                shall decide, whether or not to offer such a subject / course for two (or multiple) sections.

                <br>5.5 In case of options coming from students of other departments / branches / disciplines (not
                considering
                open electives), first priority shall be given to the student of the ‘parent department’.

                <br><br><b>6.0 Attendance requirements:</b>

                <br>6.1 A student shall be eligible to appear for the semester end examinations, if student acquires a
                minimum
                of 75% of attendance in aggregate of all the subjects / courses (excluding attendance in mandatory /
                non-credit
                courses, Environmental Science, Gender Sensitization Lab, NCC / NSO and NSS) for that semester.

                <br>6.2 Condoning of shortage of attendance in aggregate up to 10% (65% and above, and below 75%) in
                each
                semester may be granted by the college academic committee on genuine and valid grounds, based on the
                student’s
                representation with supporting evidence.

                <br>6.3 A stipulated fee shall be payable towards condoning of shortage of attendance.

                <br>6.4 Shortage of attendance below 65% in aggregate shall in no case be condoned.

                <br>6.5 Students whose shortage of attendance is not condoned in any semester are not eligible to take
                their end
                examinations of that semester. They get detained and their registration for that semester shall stand
                cancelled.
                They will not be promoted to the next semester. They may seek re-registration for all those subjects
                registered
                in that semester in which student was detained, by seeking re-admission into that semester as and when
                offered;
                in case if there are any professional electives and / or open electives, the same may also be
                re-registered if
                offered. However, if those electives are not offered in later semesters, then alternate electives may be
                chosen
                from the same set of elective subjects offered under that category.

                <br>6.6 If any student fulfills the attendance requirement in the present semester shall not be eligible
                for
                readmission into the same class.

                <br><br><b>7.0 Academic requirements</b>

                <br>The following academic requirements have to be satisfied, in addition to the attendance requirements
                mentioned in item no.6.

                <br>7.1 A student shall be deemed to have satisfied the academic requirements and earned the credits
                allotted to
                each subject / course, if student secures not less than 35% marks (26 out of 75 marks) in the semester
                end
                examination, and a minimum of 40% of marks in the sum total of the CIE (Continuous Internal Evaluation)
                and SEE
                (Semester End Examination) taken together; in terms of letter grades, this implies securing ‘C’ grade or
                above
                in that subject / course.

                <br>7.2 A student shall be deemed to have satisfied the academic requirements and earned the credits
                allotted to
                industry oriented mini-project and seminar, if student secures not less than 40% marks (i.e. 40 out of
                100
                allotted marks) in each of them. The student would be treated as failed, if student (i) does not submit
                a report
                on industry oriented mini-project, or does not make a presentation of the same before the evaluation
                committee
                as per schedule, or (ii) does not present the seminar as required in the IV year I Semester, or (iii)
                secures
                less than 40% marks in industry oriented mini-project / seminar evaluations.

                <br>Student may reappear once for each of the above evaluations, when they are scheduled again; if
                student fails
                in such ‘one reappearance’ evaluation also, student has to reappear for the same in the next subsequent
                semester, as and when it is scheduled.

                to
                successfully complete the under graduate programme.

                <br>7.5 After securing the necessary 192 credits as specified for the successful completion of the
                entire under
                graduate programme, the student can avail exemption of two subjects up to 6 credits, that is, one open

                it or failed (thereby failing to secure ‘C’ grade or above) may reappear for that subject / course in
                the
                supplementary examination as and when conducted. In such cases, internal marks (CIE) assessed earlier
                for that
                subject / course will be carried over, and added to the marks to be obtained in the SEE supplementary
                examination for evaluating performance in that subject.

                <br>7.8 When a student is detained in a semester due to shortage of attendance may be re-admitted when
                the same
                semester is offered in the next academic year for fulfillment of academic requirements. The academic
                regulations
                under which student has been readmitted shall be applicable. However, no grade allotments or SGPA / CGPA
                calculations will be done for the entire semester in which student has been detained.

                <br>7.9 A student is detained due to lack of credits shall be promoted to the next academic year only
                after
                acquiring the required academic credits. The academic regulations under which student has been
                readmitted shall
                be applicable to him.

                <br><br><b>8.0 Evaluation – Distribution and Weightage of marks</b>

                <br>8.1 The performance of a student in every subject / course (including practicals and major project)
                will be
                evaluated for 100 marks each, with 25 marks allotted for CIE (Continuous Internal Evaluation) and 75
                marks for
                SEE (Semester End-Examination).

                <br>8.2 For theory subjects, during a semester, there shall be two mid-term examinations. Each mid-term
                examination consists of one objective paper, one essay paper and one assignment. The objective paper and
                the
                essay paper shall be for 10 marks each with a total duration of 1 hour 20 minutes (20 minutes for
                objective and
                60 minutes for essay paper). The objective paper is set with 20 bits of multiple choice, fill-in the
                blanks and
                matching type of questions for a total of 10 marks. The essay paper shall contain 4 full questions out
                of which,
                the student has to answer 2 questions, each carrying 5 marks. While the first mid-term examination shall
                be
                conducted on 50% of the syllabus, the second mid-term examination shall be conducted on the remaining
                50% of the
                syllabus. Five marks are allocated for assignments (as specified by the subject teacher concerned). The
                first
                assignment should be submitted before the conduct of the first mid-examination, and the second
                assignment should
                be submitted before the conduct of the second mid-examination. The total marks secured by the student in
                each
                mid-term examination are evaluated for 25 marks, and the average of the two mid-term examinations shall
                be taken
                as the final marks secured by each student in internals / sessionals. If any student is absent from any
                subject
                of a mid-term examination, an on-line test will be conducted for him by the university. The details of
                the
                question paper pattern are as follows,

                <br>The end semester examinations will be conducted for 75 marks consisting of two parts viz. i) Part- A
                for 25
                marks, ii) Part – B for 50 marks.

                <br>Part-A is compulsory question which consists of ten sub-questions. The first five sub-questions are
                from
                each unit and carry 2 marks each. The next five sub-questions are one from each unit and carry 3 marks
                each.

                <br>Part-B consists of five questions (numbered from 2 to 6) carrying 10 marks each. Each of these
                questions is
                from one unit and may contain sub-questions. For each question there will be an “either” “or” choice,
                which
                means that there will be two questions from each unit and the student should answer either of the two
                questions.

                <br>8.3 For practical subjects there shall be a continuous internal evaluation during the semester for
                25
                sessional marks and 75 semester end examination marks. Out of the 25 marks for internal evaluation,
                day-to-day
                work in the laboratory shall be evaluated for 15 marks and internal practical examination shall be
                evaluated for
                10 marks conducted by the laboratory teacher concerned. The semester end examination shall be conducted
                with an
                external examiner and the laboratory teacher. The external examiner shall be appointed from the clusters
                of
                colleges which are decided by the examination branch of the university.

                <br>8.4 For the subject having design and / or drawing, (such as engineering graphics, engineering
                drawing,
                machine drawing) and estimation, the distribution shall be 25 marks for continuous internal evaluation
                (15 marks
                for day-to-day work and 10 marks for internal tests) and 75 marks for semester end examination. There
                shall be
                two internal tests in a semester and the average of the two shall be considered for the award of marks
                for
                internal tests.

                <br>8.5 There shall be an industry-oriented mini-project, in collaboration with an industry of their
                specialization. Students will register for this immediately after III year II semester examinations and
                pursue
                it during summer vacation. The industry oriented mini-project shall be submitted in a report form and
                presented
                before the committee in IV year I semester. It shall be evaluated for 100 marks. The committee consists
                of an
                external examiner, Head of the Department, supervisor of the mini-project and a senior faculty member of
                the
                department. There shall be no internal marks for industry-oriented mini-project.

                <br>8.6 There shall be a seminar presentation in IV year I semester. For the seminar, the student shall
                collect
                the information on a specialized topic and prepare a technical report, showing his understanding of the
                topic
                and submit it to the department. It shall be evaluated by the departmental committee consisting of Head
                of the
                Department, seminar supervisor and a senior faculty member. The seminar report shall be evaluated for
                100 marks.
                There shall be no semester end examination for the seminar.

                <br>8.7 Out of a total of 100 marks for the project work, 25 marks shall be allotted for internal
                evaluation and
                75 marks for the end semester examination (viva voce). The end semester examination of the project work
                shall be
                conducted by the same committee as appointed for the industry-oriented mini-project. In addition, the
                project
                supervisor shall also be included in the committee. The topics for industry oriented mini project,
                seminar and
                project work shall be different from one another. The evaluation of project work shall be made at the
                end of IV
                year II semester. The internal evaluation shall be on the basis of two seminars given by each student on
                the
                topic of project work.

                <br>8.8 The laboratory marks and the sessional marks awarded by the college are subject to scrutiny and
                scaling
                by the university wherever necessary. In such cases, the sessional and laboratory marks awarded by the
                college
                will be referred to a committee. The committee will arrive at a scaling factor and the marks will be
                scaled
                accordingly. The recommendations of the committee are final and binding. The laboratory records and
                internal
                test papers shall be preserved in the respective institutions as per the university rules and produced
                before
                the committees of the university as and when asked for.

                <br>8.9 For mandatory / non-credit courses like Environmental Science, Professional Ethics and gender
                sensitization lab, a student has to secure 40 marks out of 100 marks (i.e. 40% of the marks allotted) in
                the CIE
                (continuous internal evaluation) for passing the subject / course.

                <br>8.10 For Environmental Science, Gender Sensitization lab, NCC / NSO and NSS, a ‘satisfactory
                certificate’
                shall be issued to the student from the authorities concerned, only after securing 65% attendance in
                such a
                course. No marks or letter grade shall be allotted for these activities.

                <br><br><b>9.0 Grading procedure</b>

                <br>9.1 Marks will be awarded to indicate the performance of student in each theory subject, labaratory
                /

                <br>9.8 The semester grade point average (SGPA) is calculated by dividing the sum of credit points ( CP)
                secured
                from all subjects / courses registered in a semester, by the total number of credits registered during
                that
                semester. SGPA is rounded off to two decimal places. SGPA is thus computed as

                <br>SGPA = { ∑Ni=1 Ci Gi} / { ∑Ni=1 Ci } …. For each semester,

                <br>where ‘i’ is the subject indicator index (takes into account all subjects in a semester), ‘N’ is the
                no. of
                subjects ‘registered’ for the semester (as specifically required and listed under the course structure
                of the
                parent department), C is the no. of credits allotted to the ith subject, and G represents the grade
                points (GP)
                corresponding to the letter grade awarded for that ith subject.

                <br>9.9 The cumulative grade point average (CGPA) is a measure of the overall cumulative performance of
                a
                student in all semesters considered for registration. The CGPA is the ratio of the total credit points
                secured
                by a student in all registered courses in all semesters, and the total number of credits registered in
                all the
                semesters. CGPA is rounded off to two decimal places. CGPA is thus computed from the I year II semester
                onwards
                at the end of each semester as per the formula

                <br>CGPA = { ∑Mj=1 Cj Gj} / { ∑Mj=1 Cj } … for all S semesters registered

                <br>(i.e., up to and inclusive of S semesters, S 2),

                <br>where ‘M’ is the total no. of subjects (as specifically required and listed under the course
                structure of
                the parent department) the student has ‘registered’ i.e., from the 1st semester onwards up to and
                inclusive of
                the 8th semester, ‘j’ is the subject indicator index (takes into account all subjects from 1 to 8
                semesters), C
                is the no. of credits allotted to the jth subject, and G represents the grade points (GP) corresponding
                to the
                letter grade awarded for that jth subject. After registration and completion of I year I semester, the
                SGPA of
                that semester itself may be taken as the CGPA, as there are no cumulative effects.
